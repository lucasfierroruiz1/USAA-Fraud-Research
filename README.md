**Scrape → Detect → Summarize → Visualize**  
*Author: Elver Ruiz*

## Project Summary
This repository contains the completed **USAA Fraud Research Dashboard**, developed as part of an applied data science project.  

The project automates the collection, detection, and summarization of **fraud-related articles** from TechCrunch.  
It integrates **Supabase** for storage, keyword-based detection for fraud relevance, and **Streamlit** for visualization.  
The goal is to identify fraud themes, track emerging risks, and provide concise summaries for rapid analysis.

## ⚙️ ETL Pipeline

| Stage       | Description | Tools Used |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Extract** | Scrapes TechCrunch articles (title, URL, date, full text). | `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4` |
| **Transform** | Detects fraud keywords, generates summaries, deduplicates flagged articles. | `pandas`, `re`, custom `summarize_text` |
| **Load**    | Uploads structured data into **Supabase**, storing raw and clean articles with metadata. | `supabase-py` |

### 📊 ETL Workflow

## 🧩 System Architecture

| Modality | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Textual (unstructured)** | Raw article text scraped from TechCrunch. | Full article body |
| **Structured/tabular** | Metadata such as `date`, `url`, `flagged`, `keywords`. | Supabase tables |
| **Summarized (NLP)** | Condensed article summaries highlighting fraud relevance. | `summarize_text()` output |
| **Visual** | Streamlit-based charts showing keyword frequencies and flagged counts. | Word Cloud, Bar Charts |
