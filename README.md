Homepage Scraping for Keywords:

Scrape the homepage for article titles.

Use your predefined list of keywords related to fraud/scams to flag potential articles directly from the homepage by matching these keywords in the titles.

Full Article Scraping:

For the flagged articles, scrape the full articles by navigating to their individual URLs.

Extract the entire content of each article, including the title, author, publication date, and main body text.

Model-based flagging:

Run the full article content through your fraud detection model to confirm relevance.

This step ensures high accuracy, reducing false positives from just title-based filtering.

Summarization:

Apply NLP summarization methods to generate concise summaries of the flagged articles.

These summaries can be included in your reports for quick understanding and storytelling.
